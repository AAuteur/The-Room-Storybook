README

This project was inspired by my love of creativity, collaboration and coding, and my love of *The Room*. 

*The Room* is a movie that was written and directed by Tommy Wiseau that was released in 2003. It has become something of a (sub) pop cultural phenomenon and has inspired all sorts of interesting artwork and creative projects. I kinda refuse to believe that you're reading this without knowing about *The Room*, but just in case you don't know, now you know - this story is based on T.W.'s original screenplay.

*The Room Novelization* was a passion project blog written by Marcus Sullivan in 2010. It started as a serialized adaptation at [theroomnovelization.blogspot.com](http://theroomnovelization.blogspot.com) and has since been published as an ebook.

*<The Room>* is my contribution to the amazing art created by these two wunderkinds. Influenced by Mr Sullivan's incredible novelization, I have edited his original article while also adding some prose of my own and designing this presentation you're about to enjoy (hopefully). 

I hope all involved can appreciate the love and spirit behind this tribute.
